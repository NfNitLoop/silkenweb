# A List of Counters

Now we'll create a slightly more complex app, reusing our `define_counter` function from the previous example. First run the example so you can visualize how it relates to the code:

```bash
cd tutorial/counter-list
trunk serve --open
```

As you can see, its a simple counter that renders a list of counters corresponding to the first counter.
