//! A library for building reactive single page web apps
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! The best way to get started is to look at the examples. You'll need [trunk]
//! to run them. For example, to run [hello-world]:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cd examples/hello-world
//! trunk serve --open
//! ```
//!
//! - [hello-world] is a minimal example
//! - [counter] is a minimal interactive example
//! - [router] is a simple routing example
//! - [animation] is a simple animation example
//! - [todomvc] is an example of a simple app
//!

//! [Learning Silkenweb With Entirely Too Many Counters](https://silkenweb.netlify.app/)
